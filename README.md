# 💧 Project: AQUA-WISE GUARDIANS

### 🏆 Built for the Sustainovation 2025 Hackathon

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Design a water management system that helps **schools and senior centers** efficiently **monitor and conserve water**, promoting **sustainability** and **health** for all.

---

## 🚀 Our Solution: AQUA-WISE GUARDIANS

An integrated, intelligent platform that combines **IoT sensors**, **AI agents**, and **real-time dashboards** to enable **efficient water usage**, **greywater reuse**, and **interactive awareness** — especially for **students** and the **elderly**.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔁 **Greywater Reuse Monitoring**  
  Smart tracking and guidance for reusing water from washing to flushing/gardening.

- 🧠 **AI Agent Assistant**  
  Voice-enabled agent guides students and elderly through sustainable practices.

- 📉 **Smart Water Dashboard**  
  Real-time data from sensors: consumption trends, leak alerts, reuse efficiency.

- 🧪 **Sensor-Driven Leak Detection**  
  Alerts for excessive or unusual usage using low-cost sensors.

- 🧓 **Elder-Friendly Design**  
  Clean, simple UI with audio prompts for easy interaction.

- 📚 **Gamified Awareness for Students**  
  Leaderboard and rewards system for classes that save the most water.

- 🌐 **Web App Integration**  
  All systems (AI, backend, IoT) integrated into a single smart dashboard.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Sensors** installed at water outlets collect data
2. **IoT board** sends live data to Firebase
3. **Backend API** processes and updates dashboards
4. **AI Agent** interacts with users via web interface or voice
5. **Users** get real-time reports, suggestions, and alerts
